# Setup
Navigate into your workspace directory.

## 1. Clone the repo:

Run:

```git clone https://github.com/dannytpeck/unicorn-birthday-party.git```

## 2. Install the dependencies

Run:

```npm install```

## 3. Run the development server:

Run:

```npm start```

This will run a server so you can run the game in a browser.

Open your browser and enter localhost:3000 into the address bar.

Also this will start a watch process, so you can change the source and the process will recompile and refresh the browser

## Build for deployment:

Run:

```npm run build```

This will optimize and minimize the compiled bundle.
